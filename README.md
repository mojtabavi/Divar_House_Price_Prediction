# House_Price_Prediction
Data analysis and comparing different regression algorithms on dataset about Tehran housing price.

## Predicting Housing Rent Price in Tehran
Housing data generated from Tehran Divar website will be analyzed in this notebook. I use different types of ML Method for evaluating model and compare the results of those types. Predicting housing price in Tehran and also choosing a good ML algorithm is the goal of this notebook.

## Prerequisites
I use some famous python libraries like numpy, pandas, sklearn and seaborn. In order to do some specific activies.

Tip The instruction of !pip install ... is written in the notebook to ensure that all libraries are installed in the destination machine.

## Files
